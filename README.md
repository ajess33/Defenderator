# CESSPIT melee edition

CESSPIT (the common enemy simply scaling positive incremental transposer) is the 2nd installment in the 
Delta V D&D suite.

A tool crafted for Dungeon Masterss who want one less thing to worry about during session, CESSPIT allows for quick
adjustment of monster stats for those pesky players who seem too powerful for a given encounter. 
Incrementally increasing each stat gives power to those puny monsters who can't quite take a hit or no
longer pack a punch!

CESSPIT allows save states for each of the monsters you've adjusted and let's the user swap between stat
displays for quick acess to a multitude of monsters!

Included with the base model are 5 pre loaded monsters to toss at your players. The user can also jump
to the create your own monster page and build their own beast to bash in brains! Once built hop on back 
to the adjustment section and power up the pain if players aren't quite feeling it!
