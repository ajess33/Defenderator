      <h3><span>CESSPIT</span> (melee edition)</h3>
      <pre>
Cesspit (the common enemy simply scaling positive incremental transposer) is the 2nd installment in the
Delta V D&D suite.

A tool crafted for DMs who want one less thing to worry about during session, Cesspit allows for quick
adjustment of monster stats for those pesky players who seem to powerful for a given encounter.
Incrementally increasing each stat gives power to those puny monsters who can't quite take a hit or no
longer pack a punch!</pre>

          his fighting skills at FabPro. His top abilities are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. He is hoping this experience
          in the battlefield will set him for the real war to come when he moves to FabPro.</p>
