Share the Problem
    There are many Dungeon Masters across the world who tire of ceaseless busy work. 
    Making monsters, writing stats and then inevitably swapping them out for new monsters
    or doing last minute calculations to increase their power when encounters aren't difficult enough.
Introduce CessPit (melee edition)
    What it is/how it solves the problem
Walkthrough of CessPit

    Create your own Form
        what it is
            option to allow DMs to input their own campaign specific monsters
        submit and save
    Go back to create/increment page and show off the drop down (oh hey there are the save monsters from before)
